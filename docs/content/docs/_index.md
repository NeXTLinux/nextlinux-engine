### Welcome to Nextlinux Engine

Nextlinux Engine is a system to help automate the description and enforcement of requirements on the content of docker containers.

With a bit more detail? Nextlinux Engine is a Docker container static analysis and policy-based compliance tool that automates the inspection, analysis, and evaluation of images against user-defined checks to allow high confidence in container deployments by ensuring workload content meets the required criteria. Nextlinux Engine ultimately provides a policy evaluation result for each image: pass/fail against policies defined by the user. Additionally, the way that policies are defined and evaluated allows the policy evaluation itself to double as an audit mechanism that allows point-in-time evaluations of specific image properties and content attributes.
