&lt;p>The Nextlinux Engine can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines such as Jenkins to secure the CI/CD pipeline by adding image scanning including not just CVE based security scans but policy based scans that can include checks around security, compliance and operational best practices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of the CI/CD workflow images are submitted to the Nextlinux Engine for analysis. If an image does not pass the policy checks then the build can be failed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Images that pass the policy check can be promoted to the production registry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some users may implement a gating workflow where policy violations fail the build, other users may prefer to allow the build to proceed but provide a warning to the developer and operations team about the violations present in the image.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A plugin is available for Jenkins that supports Freestyle jobs and Pipeline jobs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For other CI/CD systems Integration is as simple as making two API or CLI calls to the engine&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Submit image for analysis&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Retrieve image policy status.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>These calls can be made using the Nextlinux CLI or through the Nextlinux REST API.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: Kubernetes Integration</title><link>/docs/general/concepts/integrations/kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/general/concepts/integrations/kubernetes/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Nextlinux Engine can be integrated with Kubernetes to ensure that only certified images are started within a Kubernetes POD.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kubernetes can be configured to use an Admission Controller to validate that the container image is compliant with the user&amp;rsquo;s policy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The admission controller can be configured to make a webhook call into the Nextlinux Engine. The Nextlinux Engine exports a Kubernetes-specific API endpoint and will return the pass of fail response in the form of an ImageReview response.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="k8s.png" alt="alt text">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This approach allows the Kubernetes system to make the final decision on running an container image and does not require installation of any per-node plugins into Kubernetes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using native Kubernetes features allows this approach to be used in both on-prem and cloud hosted Kubernetes environments.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
